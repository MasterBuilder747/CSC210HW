/*

-Linear interpolation should be performed using the function you wrote previously, you may copy and paste the code into your Mandelbrot.java class
-Complex arithmetic is performed using your ComplexNumber class, you may copy it into the package for this assignment

Zn+1 = Zn^2 + C
where c is a complex number

does magnitude of Zn tend to infinity?

INPUT: C, complex number (class)
PROCESS: does Zn+1 = Zn^2 + C tend to infinity?
OUTPUT: true/false
